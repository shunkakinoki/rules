# /pr-create â€” Comprehensive PR creation workflow

Use this command when preparing a pull request. Follow each section before running `gh pr create`.

## Prerequisites

### GitHub CLI Setup
- **Install GitHub CLI**: `which gh` (install if not found)
- **Verify authentication**: `gh auth status`
- **Required token scope**: Token must have `repo` scope for PR creation
- **Authentication**: Run `gh auth login` if not authenticated

### Branch Requirements
- **Work on feature branches** (never commit directly to `main`)
- **Keep branches focused** on single features/fixes
- **Use descriptive names** (e.g., `fix-build-dependencies`, `feat-user-auth`)
- **Current branch check**: `git branch --show-current`

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Changes
```bash
# Check current status and see what files changed
git status

# Stage specific files or all changes
git add <files>          # Stage specific files
git add .               # Stage all changes in current directory

# Or use interactive staging for complex changes
git add -p              # Interactive patch staging
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch (if needed)
```bash
# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Or switch to existing feature branch
git checkout existing-feature-branch

# Verify you're on the correct branch
git branch --show-current
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes
```bash
# Commit with conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system

- Add login form component
- Implement JWT token handling
- Add user session management

Closes #123"

# Or use /commit-and-push command for guided workflow
# Reference: /commit-and-push
```

### Step 4: Push Branch
```bash
# Push and set upstream (first time only)
git push -u origin feature-branch-name

# Subsequent pushes (no -u needed)
git push
```

### Step 5: Create PR via CLI
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add user authentication system" \
  --body "## Changes Made
- Added login form component with validation
- Implemented JWT token handling and storage
- Added user session management utilities
- Updated routing to protect authenticated routes

## Technical Details
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Implements secure token storage in localStorage
- Adds middleware for route protection
- Follows existing component patterns and styling

## Testing
- Verified login/logout flow works correctly
- All pre-commit hooks pass (Biome formatting, linting)
- Component tests added for auth utilities
- Manual testing completed on all major browsers
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

ðŸ¤– Generated with <AI NAME>" \
  --base main \
  --head feature-branch-name
```

## PR Content Standards

### Title Format
- **Use conventional commit format**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- **Keep under 72 characters** for optimal display
- **Be specific and actionable**: "Add user auth" vs "Update stuff"
- **Include scope if relevant**: `fix(auth): resolve login issue`

### Description Requirements
- **Changes Made**: Bullet list of what was modified
- **Technical Details**: Implementation specifics and rationale
- **Testing**: Verification steps and pre-commit status
- **AI Attribution**: `ðŸ¤– Generated with <AI NAME>` (current assistant)

### AI Attribution Guidelines
- **Current assistant**: Replace `<AI NAME>` with your AI assistant name
- **Format**: `ðŸ¤– Generated with <AI NAME>` (no co-authorship)
- **Placement**: At the end of PR description
- **Consistency**: Use same attribution across all generated content

## Labeling & Reviewers

### Automatic Labeling
After PR creation, add appropriate labels:
```bash
# Feature PR
gh pr edit <number> --add-label enhancement

# Bug fix PR
gh pr edit <number> --add-label bug

# Documentation PR
gh pr edit <number> --add-label documentation

# Dependencies PR
gh pr edit <number> --add-label dependencies
```

### Request Reviewers
```bash
# Add specific reviewers
gh pr edit <number> --add-reviewer username1,username2

# Add team reviewers
gh pr edit <number> --add-reviewer "@org/team-name"
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Authentication failed**: Run `gh auth login`
- **Branch not found**: Ensure branch is pushed to remote first
- **Permission denied**: Check repository access and token scopes
- **PR already exists**: Use `gh pr edit` to modify existing PR

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr list

# View PR details
gh pr view <number>

# Update PR description
gh pr edit <number> --body "Updated description"

# Change PR title
gh pr edit <number> --title "Updated title"

# Close PR
gh pr close <number>
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Guidelines
- **Solo-authored commits only** - DO NOT include co-authorship in commit messages
- **NO co-authorship** - Never add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar co-authorship attribution in commits
- **AI name belongs in PR description only** - Use `ðŸ¤– Generated with <AI NAME>` format in PR body, not commit messages
- **Use present tense** in commit messages ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Keep commits atomic** and focused on single changes
- **Reference issues** when applicable (`Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`)

### PR Size Management
- **Keep PRs focused** on single concerns or related changes
- **Split large changes** into multiple smaller PRs
- **Use draft PRs** for work-in-progress or incomplete features
- **Request reviews early** for complex changes to get feedback

### Quality Assurance
- **Ensure all pre-commit hooks pass** before creating PR
- **Run tests** before creating PR (adapt commands based on detected package manager)
- **Verify code formatting** (Biome handles this automatically)
- **Check for breaking changes** and document them clearly
- **Test manually** for UI/UX changes

#### Package Manager Detection for Testing

Before running tests, detect which package manager is being used:

```bash
# Check for package manager
if [ -f "bun.lockb" ] || [ -f "bun.lock" ]; then
  PACKAGE_MANAGER="bun"
elif [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then
  PACKAGE_MANAGER="pnpm"
elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then
  PACKAGE_MANAGER="yarn"
elif [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then
  PACKAGE_MANAGER="npm"
else
  PACKAGE_MANAGER="npm"  # fallback to npm
fi

# Run tests with detected package manager
$PACKAGE_MANAGER run test
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **PRs automatically trigger** CI pipelines
- **Address failing checks** promptly (tests, linting, formatting)
- **Monitor CI status** and fix issues before requesting review
- **Document known limitations** if any checks are expected to fail

## Complete Example

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat-add-user-auth

# 2. Make changes and stage
git add src/components/Auth/ src/utils/auth.ts
git status

# 3. Commit with conventional format with no co-authorship
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication system

- Implement JWT token management and secure storage
- Create auth context for global state management
- Add protected route wrapper component

Closes #123"

# 4. Push to remote
git push -u origin feat-add-user-auth

gh pr create \
  --title "feat: implement user authentication system" \
  --body "## Changes Made

```
